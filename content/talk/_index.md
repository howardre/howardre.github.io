summary: Poster
abstract: "The commercial groundfish fishing industry and fisheries research have long been present on the Oregon continental shelf. Within the non-whiting groundfish fishery, the target species are primarily flatfishes, sablefish, lingcod, and rockfishes, though landings of each have fluctuated over time. Recent work shows that in the past two decades fishing efforts have shifted offshore, likely due to implementation of strict gear regulations, area closures, and lower catch limits. Although federal fisheries-independent surveys have been conducted across most of the fishery’s depth range, data is limited by years and seasons surveyed as well as absence of data in the shallowest waters (<50m). Fishery-dependent data covers those shallow waters and broader temporal range but at coarse scale. Limitations in data coverage combined with a historical focus on deeper water groundfishes has led to a gap in understanding dynamics of the nearshore fishery, particularly regarding the influence of environmental factors on abundance and distribution. Here we assess changes in the spatiotemporal dynamics of the Oregon nearshore non-whiting groundfish trawl fishery over the past four decades. Statistical modeling is used to assess distribution shifts in species and temporal changes in community composition. These analyses have revealed how species’ spatial distributions have shifted over time and the community composition of the shelf habitat. Visualizing both fishery-independent and -dependent data allows us to qualitatively compare data coverage as well as assess differences in species distribution when mapping each dataset. These analyses illuminate where knowledge gaps lie in both data types and how they complement one another."
