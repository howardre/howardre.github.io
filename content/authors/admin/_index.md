I am a Ph.D. Candidate at Oregon State University in the College of Earth, Ocean, and Atmospheric Sciences in the [Fisheries Oceanography Lab](https://fisheriesoceanographylab.ceoas.oregonstate.edu/) and a Research Fish Biologist at the NOAA Fisheries Alaska Fisheries Science Center in the [Resource Assessment and Conservation Engineering Division](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/about/resource-assessment-and-conservation-engineering-division) for the [Groundfish Assessment Program](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/contact/groundfish-assessment-program). I received my master's in [Marine Resource Management](https://ceoas.oregonstate.edu/mrm) at OSU in September 2020 and I am continuing on with my Ph.D. research in the Ocean, Earth and Atmospheric Sciences program with a concentration in [Ocean Ecology and Biogeochemistry](https://ceoas.oregonstate.edu/ocean-ecology-and-biogeochemistry). My current research focuses on forecasting the spawning distributions of groundfishes in the Bering Sea using the [Bering10K ROMS-NPZ](https://beringnpz.github.io/roms-bering-sea/B10K-dataset-docs/), developing species distribution models for different life stages of snow crab (*Chionoecetes opilio*), and evaluating the use of size-structured models for projecting the distributions of California Current fishes. Some of my research interests include using statistical modeling approaches to understand how populations of marine species respond to changes in ocean conditions over time and space, investigating how different fishery data sources can be used to study commercially important populations, and the connections between science and management.
