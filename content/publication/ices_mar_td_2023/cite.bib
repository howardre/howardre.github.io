	abstract = {The Bering Sea is a productive large marine ecosystem that supports numerous
6 commercial fisheries while climate change is introducing rapid warming and freshening,
7 especially in coastal water. The success of early life stages of marine fishes can impact adult
8 abundance levels; little is known about how behavioral or physiological plasticity in relation to
9 environmental changes at one stage (e.g., spawning) may affect survival during subsequent
10 stages (e.g., larvae), nor whether trade-offs exist that affect how a species demonstrates such
11 plasticity. We utilized a statistical approach to examine phenological and geographical flexibility
12 in spawning behavior for four species of groundfishes. In situ sea surface temperature (SST) and
13 salinity (SSS) associations were also estimated by statistical models for six species of groundfish
14 larvae. All species exhibited greater spawning geography flexibility than phenological flexibility
15 during the egg stage. All larval stages exhibited specific temperature and salinity associations
16 across unique combinations of SST and SSS. These species-specific patterns, in the context of
17 potential climate change impacts, suggest that flexibility in spawning behavior may not
18 adequately compensate for the presence of unfavorable habitats at the larval stage.
